JSON-Poll
---------

Simple JSON polling tool.

This is a simple app to poll a URL for JSON data once per second. I wrote this because I implemented a stats
page for my server but was too lazy to create a GUI for it (but apparently not lazy enough to write a nw.js app).

### Installation

First you need to install nw.js (https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js). Actually.. first you need to install node.js
but I'm going to assume you already have node.js working. If not, google around for how to install node.

The simplest way to install nw.js is probably via npm. Just run:

    npm install -g nw

That's basically it. Once you have nw.js installed you can run this app.

### Running the app

To run the app, `cd` into this directory then run `nw`.
